# üß† Medical Imaging RAG + Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

## Overview
This project integrates **deep learning, physics-informed modeling, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for advanced analysis of brain MRI data.  
It unifies **tumor classification, segmentation, growth modeling, and biomedical literature retrieval** into a single pipeline for multi-perspective clinical reporting.

## Key Components
- **Tumor Classification**
  - Trained on **Figshare Brain Tumor Dataset** (meningioma, glioma, pituitary).
  - Achieved ~80% accuracy (DenseNet121).

- **3D Tumor Segmentation**
  - Trained on **BraTS2020 dataset** with 3D UNet.
  - Dice coefficient ~0.78‚Äì0.82 for tumor boundaries.

- **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)**
  - Modeled tumor dynamics using **reaction‚Äìdiffusion PDEs**.
  - Learned parameters: **diffusion coefficient (D), growth rate (œÅ)**.
  - Simulated tumor progression with spatial and temporal dynamics.

- **Anatomical Localization**
  - Atlas-based mapping to cortical and subcortical regions.
  - Provided functional impact predictions (motor, sensory, language, etc.).

- **Biomedical RAG System**
  - Sources: **PubMed Central (full-text), Europe PMC, PubMed**.
  - Uses **Mistral LLM** + **PubMedBERT embeddings** with FAISS.
  - Generates **evidence-backed clinical insights** from literature.

## Status
‚úÖ All modules implemented (classification, segmentation, PINN, RAG)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Current limitation: outputs sometimes inconsistent across modules (classification vs location vs growth).  
üéØ Future direction: tighter cross-module integration and self-consistency checks.
